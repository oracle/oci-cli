Interactive Features
--------------------
OCI CLI offers interactive features to guide you through command usage.

Enabling them allows:
    * Suggestions and autocompletion to help compose commands;
    * Color-coded suggestions to distinguish required parameters from optional parameters; and
    * Quick references display alongside suggestions to recognize command and parameter purposes.

Try the interactive features anytime with the ``-i`` option:
::

    oci -i
