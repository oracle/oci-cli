-------------------

Added
~~~~~~~~~~
* Support for new Database service operations: VM DBs, Bring Your Own License, and Data Guard.
* Support for autocomplete on Windows (PowerShell only)
* Support for defaults file to specify default values for CLI parameters (https://github.com/oracle/oci-cli/issues/20)
* Support for parallelization in bulk object storage commands: bulk upload / download / delete).
* Support for including / excluding files in bulk upload / download / delete based on file patterns.
* Support for enabling / disabling VNIC source/destination checks (https://github.com/oracle/oci-cli/issues/15)
* Support for adding and updating display names for captured instance serial console data.
* Display public key fingerprint in output of 'oci setup config' (https://github.com/oracle/oci-cli/issues/18)

Fixed
~~~~~~~~~~
* Allow piping input through STDIN for 'oci os object put' (https://github.com/oracle/oci-cli/issues/21)
* Use full path when writing 'key_file' in 'oci setup config' (https://github.com/oracle/oci-cli/issues/19)
* Added missing files and instructions to allow running tests

Deprecated
~~~~~~~~~~
* oci bv volume create --size-in-mbs parameter is now deprecated in favor of the new --size-in-gbs parameter

2.4.9 - 2017-09-13
------------------

Fixed
~~~~~~~~~~
* On Windows, fall back to old default config location (%USERPROFILE%\.oraclebmc\config) if new default location doesn't exist (%USERPROFILE%\.oci\config).

Added
~~~~~~~~~~
* Support for CustomerSecretKey operations (oci iam customer-secret-key create / delete / list / update).

2.4.8 - 2017-09-11
------------------

Deprecated
~~~~~~~~~~
* The CLI entry point (command name) has been changed from bmcs to oci. The old entry point will continue to work, but is deprecated.
* The CLI package name has been changed from oraclebmc-cli to oci-cli. The oraclebmc-cli package is deprecated and will no longer be maintained starting March 2018. Please upgrade to the oci-cli package to avoid interruption at that time.
* The default configuration file location has been changed from ~/.oraclebmc/config to ~/.oci/config. The old location still works if the file at the new location does not exist.

Added
~~~~~
* Support for the Database service
* Object Storage bulk operations (oci os object bulk-upload / bulk-download / bulk-delete)
* Support for compartment renaming
* Scripts to simplify install process
* Complex input can now be provided as a file instead of having to escape JSON input at the command line. The path to the file can be provided using the file:// prefix, for example --my-complex-param file://<path>, and the following paths are supported

  * Relative paths from the same directory, such as file://my-input.json and file://relative/path/to/input.json
  * Absolute paths on Linux, macOS or Unix, such as file:///absolute/path/to/input.json
  * Full file paths on Windows, such as file://C:\path\to\input.json
  * Using file path expansions, for example '~/', './', and '../' is supported. On Windows, the '~/' expression expands to your user directory, stored in the %USERPROFILE% environment variable
  * Using environment variables in paths is also supported

Changed
~~~~~~~
* The default configuration file location is now ~/.oci/config
