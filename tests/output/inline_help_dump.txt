$ oci --help
Usage: oci [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Oracle Cloud Infrastructure command line interface, with support for Block
  Volume, Compute, Database, IAM, Load Balancing, Networking, and Object
  Storage Services.

  Most commands must specify a service, followed by a resource type and then
  an action. For example, to list users (where $T contains the OCID of the
  current tenant):

    oci iam user list --compartment-id $T

  Output is in JSON format.

  For information on configuration, see https://docs.us-
  phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/API/Concepts/sdkconfig.htm.

Options:
  -v, --version                   Show the version and exit.
  --config-file TEXT              The path to the config file.  [default:
                                  ~/.oci/config]
  --profile TEXT                  The profile in the config file to load. This
                                  profile will also be used to locate any
                                  default parameter values which have been
                                  specified in the OCI CLI-specific
                                  configuration file.  [default: DEFAULT]
  --cli-rc-file, --defaults-file TEXT
                                  The path to the OCI CLI-specific configuration
                                  file, containing parameter default values and
                                  other configuration information such as
                                  command aliases and predefined queries. The
                                  --defaults-file option is deprecated and you
                                  should use the --cli-rc-file option instead.
                                  [default: ~/.oci/oci_cli_rc]
  --opc-request-id, --opc-client-request-id, --request-id TEXT
                                  The request id to use for tracking the
                                  request.
  --region TEXT                   The region to make calls against.  For a list
                                  of valid region names use the command: "oci
                                  iam region list".
  --endpoint TEXT                 The value to use as the service endpoint,
                                  including any required API version path. For
                                  example: "https://iaas.us-
                                  phoenix-1.oracle.com/20160918". This will
                                  override the default service endpoint / API
                                  version path. Note: The --region parameter is
                                  the recommended way of targeting different
                                  regions.

                                  used for SSL verification. This will override
                                  the default CA certificate bundle.
  --output [json|table]           The output format. [Default is json]
  --query TEXT                    JMESPath query [http://jmespath.org/] to run
                                  on the response JSON before output.
                                  
                                  Queries
                                  can be entered directly on the command line or
                                  referenced from the [OCI_CLI_COMMAND_ALIASES]
                                  section of your configuration file by using
                                  the syntax query://<query_name>, for example
                                  query://get_id_and_name
  --raw-output                    If the output of a given query is a single
                                  string value, this will return the string
                                  without surrounding quotes
  --auth [api_key|instance_principal]
                                  The type of auth to use for the API request.
                                  By default the API key in your config file
                                  will be used.  This value can also be provided
                                  in the OCI_CLI_AUTH environment variable.
  --generate-full-command-json-input
                                  Prints out a JSON document which represents
                                  all possible options that can be provided to
                                  this command.
                                  
                                  This JSON document can be saved
                                  to a file, modified with the appropriate
                                  option values, and then passed back via the
                                  --from-json option. This provides an
                                  alternative to typing options out on the
                                  command line.
  --generate-param-json-input TEXT
                                  Complex input, such as arrays and objects, are
                                  passed in JSON format.
                                  
                                  When passed the name
                                  of an option which takes complex input, this
                                  will print out example JSON of what needs to
                                  be passed to that option.

  Returns all audit events for the specified compartment that were processed
  within the specified time range.

Options:
  -c, --compartment-id TEXT  The OCID of the compartment. [required]
  --start-time DATETIME      Returns events that were processed at or after this
                             start date and time, expressed in [RFC 3339]
                             timestamp format. For example, a start value of
                             `2017-01-15T11:30:00Z` will retrieve a list of all
                             events processed since 30 minutes after the 11th
                             hour of January 15, 2017, in Coordinated Universal
                             Time (UTC). You can specify a value with
                             granularity to the minute. Seconds (and
                             milliseconds, if included) must be set to `0`.

                             format. For example, a start value of
                             `2017-01-01T00:00:00Z` and an end value of
                             `2017-01-02T00:00:00Z` will retrieve a list of all
                             events processed on January 1, 2017. Similarly, a
                             start value of `2017-01-01T00:00:00Z` and an end
                             value of `2017-02-01T00:00:00Z` will result in a
                             list of all events processed between January 1,
                             2017 and January 31, 2017. You can specify a value
                             with granularity to the minute. Seconds (and

$ oci bv volume create --help
Usage: oci bv volume create [OPTIONS]

  Creates a new volume in the specified compartment. Volumes can be created in
  sizes ranging from 50 GB (51200 MB) to 16 TB (16777216 MB), in 1 GB (1024
  MB) increments. By default, volumes are 1 TB (1048576 MB). For general
  information about block volumes, see [Overview of Block Volume Service].

  A volume and instance can be in separate compartments but must be in the
  same Availability Domain. For information about access control and
  compartments, see [Overview of the IAM Service]. For information about
  Availability Domains, see [Regions and Availability Domains]. To get a list
  of Availability Domains, use the `ListAvailabilityDomains` operation in the
  Identity and Access Management Service API.

  You may optionally specify a *display name* for the volume, which is simply
  a friendly name or description. It does not have to be unique, and you can
  change it. Avoid entering confidential information.

$ oci compute console-history capture --help
Usage: oci compute console-history capture [OPTIONS]

  Captures the most recent serial console data (up to a megabyte) for the
  specified instance.

  The `CaptureConsoleHistory` operation works with the other console history
  operations as described below.

  1. Use `CaptureConsoleHistory` to request the capture of up to a megabyte of
  the most recent console history. This call returns a `ConsoleHistory`
  object. The object will have a state of REQUESTED. 2. Wait for the capture
  operation to succeed by polling `GetConsoleHistory` with the identifier of
  the console history metadata. The state of the `ConsoleHistory` object will
  go from REQUESTED to GETTING-HISTORY and then SUCCEEDED (or FAILED). 3. Use
  `GetConsoleHistoryContent` to get the actual console history data (not the
  metadata). 4. Optionally, use `DeleteConsoleHistory` to delete the console
  history metadata and the console history data.

Options:
  --instance-id TEXT              The OCID of the instance to get the console
                                  history from. [required]

  --sort-order [ASC|DESC]         The sort order to use, either ascending
                                  (`ASC`) or descending (`DESC`). The
                                  DISPLAYNAME sort order is case sensitive.
  --lifecycle-state [REQUESTED|GETTING-HISTORY|SUCCEEDED|FAILED]
                                  A filter to only return resources that match
                                  the given lifecycle state.  The state value is
                                  case-insensitive.
  --all                           Fetches all pages of results. If you provide
                                  this option, then you cannot provide the

$ oci compute image create --help
Usage: oci compute image create [OPTIONS]

  Creates a boot disk image for the specified instance or imports an exported
  image from the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Object Storage service.

  When creating a new image, you must provide the OCID of the instance you
  want to use as the basis for the image, and the OCID of the compartment
  containing that instance. For more information about images, see [Managing
  Custom Images].

  When importing an exported image from Object Storage, you specify the source
  information in [ImageSourceDetails].

  When importing an image based on the namespace, bucket name, and object
  name, use [ImageSourceViaObjectStorageTupleDetails].

  When importing an image based on the Object Storage URL, use
  [ImageSourceViaObjectStorageUriDetails]. See [Object Storage URLs] and [pre-
  authenticated requests] for constructing URLs for image import/export.

  For more information about importing exported images, see [Image
  Import/Export].

  You may optionally specify a *display name* for the image, which is simply a
  friendly name or description. It does not have to be unique, and you can
  change it. See [UpdateImage]. Avoid entering confidential information.

Options:
  -c, --compartment-id TEXT       The OCID of the compartment containing the
                                  instance you want to use as the basis for the

$ oci compute image list --help
Usage: oci compute image list [OPTIONS]

  Lists the available images in the specified compartment. If you specify a
  value for the `sortBy` parameter, Oracle-provided images appear first in the
  list, followed by custom images. For more information about images, see
  [Managing Custom Images].

Options:
  -c, --compartment-id TEXT       The OCID of the compartment. [required]
  --display-name TEXT             A filter to return only resources that match
                                  the given display name exactly.
  --operating-system TEXT         The image's operating system.
                                  
                                  Example:
                                  `Oracle Linux`
  --operating-system-version TEXT
                                  The image's operating system version.
                                  Example: `7.2`
  --shape TEXT                    Shape name.
  --limit INTEGER                 The maximum number of items to return in a
                                  paginated "List" call.
                                  
                                  Example: `500`
  --page TEXT                     The value of the `opc-next-page` response
                                  header from the previous "List" call.
  --sort-by [TIMECREATED|DISPLAYNAME]
                                  The field to sort by. You can provide one sort
                                  order (`sortOrder`). Default order for
                                  TIMECREATED is descending. Default order for
                                  DISPLAYNAME is ascending. The DISPLAYNAME sort
                                  order is case sensitive.
                                  
                                  **Note:** In
                                  general, some "List" operations (for example,
                                  `ListInstances`) let you optionally filter by
                                  Availability Domain if the scope of the
                                  resource type is within a single Availability
                                  Domain. If you call one of these "List"
                                  operations without specifying an Availability
                                  Domain, the resources are grouped by
                                  Availability Domain, then sorted.
  --sort-order [ASC|DESC]         The sort order to use, either ascending
                                  (`ASC`) or descending (`DESC`). The
                                  DISPLAYNAME sort order is case sensitive.
  --lifecycle-state [PROVISIONING|IMPORTING|AVAILABLE|EXPORTING|DISABLED|DELETED]
                                  A filter to only return resources that match
                                  the given lifecycle state.  The state value is
                                  case-insensitive.
  --all                           Fetches all pages of results. If you provide
                                  this option, then you cannot provide the
                                  --limit option.
  --page-size INTEGER             When fetching results, the number of results
                                  to fetch per call. Only valid when used with
                                  --all or --limit, and ignored otherwise.
  --from-json TEXT                Provide input to this command as a JSON
                                  document from a file.
                                  
                                  Options can still be
                                  provided on the command line. If an option
                                  exists in both the JSON document and the

$ oci compute instance action --help
Usage: oci compute instance action [OPTIONS]

  Performs one of the power actions (start, stop, softreset, or reset) on the
  specified instance.

  **start** - power on

  **stop** - power off

  **softreset** - ACPI shutdown and power on

  **reset** - power off and power on

  Note that the **stop** state has no effect on the resources you consume.
  Billing continues for instances that you stop, and related resources
  continue to apply against any relevant quotas. You must terminate an
  instance ([TerminateInstance]) to remove its resources from billing and
  quotas.

$ oci compute instance attach-vnic --help
Usage: oci compute instance attach-vnic [OPTIONS]

  Creates a secondary VNIC and attaches it to the specified instance. For more
  information about secondary VNICs, see [Virtual Network Interface Cards
  (VNICs)].

Options:
  --instance-id TEXT              The OCID of the instance. [required]
  --subnet-id TEXT                The OCID of the subnet to create the VNIC in.
                                  [required]
  --vnic-display-name TEXT        A user-friendly name for the VNIC. Does not
                                  have to be unique.
  --assign-public-ip BOOLEAN      Whether the VNIC should be assigned a public
                                  IP address. Defaults to whether the subnet is
                                  public or private. If not set and the VNIC is
                                  being created in a private subnet (i.e., where
                                  prohibitPublicIpOnVnic=true in the Subnet),
                                  then no public IP address is assigned. If not
                                  set and the subnet is public
                                  (prohibitPublicIpOnVnic=false), then a public
                                  IP address is assigned. If set to true and
                                  prohibitPublicIpOnVnic=true, an error is
                                  returned.
  --skip-source-dest-check BOOLEAN
                                  Indicates whether Source/Destination check is
                                  disabled on the VNIC. Defaults to `false`, in
                                  which case we enable Source/Destination check
                                  on the VNIC.
  --private-ip TEXT               A private IP address of your choice to assign
                                  to the VNIC. Must be an available IP address
                                  within the subnet's CIDR. If no value is
                                  specified, a private IP address from the
                                  subnet will be automatically assigned.
  --hostname-label TEXT           The hostname for the VNIC. Used for DNS. The
                                  value is the hostname portion of the VNIC's
                                  fully qualified domain name (FQDN) (e.g.,
                                  `bminstance-1` in FQDN
                                  `bminstance-1.subnet123.vcn1.oraclevcn.com`).

                                  the VNIC will use. Defaults to 0. Certain bare
                                  metal instance shapes have two active physical
                                  NICs (0 and 1). If you add a secondary VNIC to
                                  one of these instances, you can specify which
                                  NIC the VNIC will use.
  --wait                          If set, then wait for the attachment to
                                  complete and return the newly attached VNIC.
                                  If not set, then the command will not wait and
                                  will return nothing on success.
  --from-json TEXT                Provide input to this command as a JSON

$ oci compute instance launch --help
Usage: oci compute instance launch [OPTIONS]

  Creates a new instance in the specified compartment and the specified
  Availability Domain. For general information about instances, see [Overview
  of the Compute Service].

  For information about access control and compartments, see [Overview of the
  IAM Service].

  For information about Availability Domains, see [Regions and Availability
  Domains]. To get a list of Availability Domains, use the
  `ListAvailabilityDomains` operation in the Identity and Access Management
  Service API.

  All Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources, including instances, get an
  Oracle-assigned, unique ID called an Oracle Cloud Identifier (OCID). When
  you create a resource, you can find its OCID in the response. You can also
  retrieve a resource's OCID by using a List API operation on that resource
  type, or by viewing the resource in the Console.

  To launch an instance using an image or a boot volume use the
  `sourceDetails` parameter in [LaunchInstanceDetails].

  When you launch an instance, it is automatically attached to a virtual
  network interface card (VNIC), called the *primary VNIC*. The VNIC has a
  private IP address from the subnet's CIDR. You can either assign a private
  IP address of your choice or let Oracle automatically assign one. You can
  choose whether the instance has a public IP address. To retrieve the
  addresses, use the [ListVnicAttachments] operation to get the VNIC ID for
  the instance, and then call [GetVnic] with the VNIC ID.

  You can later add secondary VNICs to an instance. For more information, see
  [Virtual Network Interface Cards (VNICs)].

Options:
  --availability-domain TEXT      The Availability Domain of the instance.
                                  Example: `Uocm:PHX-AD-1` [required]
  -c, --compartment-id TEXT       The OCID of the compartment. [required]
  --shape TEXT                    The shape of an instance. The shape determines

                                  other resources allocated to the instance.
                                  You can enumerate all available shapes by
                                  calling [ListShapes]. [required]
  --defined-tags COMPLEX TYPE     Defined tags for this resource. Each key is

                                  value is the hostname portion of the
                                  instance's fully qualified domain name (FQDN)
                                  (e.g., `bminstance-1` in FQDN
                                  `bminstance-1.subnet123.vcn1.oraclevcn.com`).
                                  Must be unique across all VNICs in the subnet
                                  and comply with [RFC 952] and [RFC 1123]. The
                                  value cannot be changed, and it can be
                                  retrieved from the [Vnic].

                                  Example: `bminstance-1`
  --image-id TEXT                 The OCID of the image used to boot the
                                  instance. This is a shortcut for specifying an
                                  image source via the --source-details complex
                                  JSON parameter. If this parameter is provided,
                                  you cannot provide the --source-details or
                                  --source-boot-volume-id parameters.
  --ipxe-script-file FILENAME     This is an advanced option.
                                  
                                  When a bare metal
                                  or virtual machine instance boots, the iPXE
                                  firmware that runs on the instance is
                                  configured to run an iPXE script to continue
                                  the boot process.
                                  
                                  If you want more control
                                  over the boot process, you can provide your
                                  own custom iPXE script that will run when the
                                  instance boots; however, you should be aware
                                  that the same iPXE script will run every time
                                  an instance boots; not only after the initial
                                  LaunchInstance call.
                                  
                                  The default iPXE script
                                  connects to the instance's local boot volume
                                  over iSCSI and performs a network boot. If you
                                  use a custom iPXE script and want to network-
                                  boot from the instance's local boot volume
                                  over iSCSI the same way as the default iPXE
                                  script, you should use the following iSCSI IP
                                  address: 169.254.0.2, and boot volume IQN:
                                  iqn.2015-02.oracle.boot.

                                  a file, modifying it as needed and then
                                  passing it back in via the file:// syntax.
  --subnet-id TEXT                The OCID of the subnet where the VNIC attached
                                  to this instance will be created.
  --wait-for-state [PROVISIONING|RUNNING|STARTING|STOPPING|STOPPED|CREATING_IMAGE|TERMINATING|TERMINATED]
                                  This operation creates, modifies or deletes a
                                  resource that has a defined lifecycle state.
                                  Specify this option to perform the action and
                                  then wait until the resource reaches a given
                                  lifecycle state.
  --max-wait-seconds INTEGER      The maximum time to wait for the resource to
                                  reach the lifecycle state defined by --wait-
                                  for-state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
  --wait-interval-seconds INTEGER
                                  Check every --wait-interval-seconds to see
                                  whether the resource to see if it has reached
                                  the lifecycle state defined by --wait-for-
                                  state. Defaults to 30 seconds.
  --vnic-display-name TEXT        A user-friendly name for the default VNIC
                                  attached to this instance. Does not have to be
                                  unique.
  --assign-public-ip BOOLEAN      Whether the default VNIC attached to this
                                  instance should be assigned a public IP
                                  address. Defaults to whether the subnet is
                                  public or private. If not set and the VNIC is
                                  being created in a private subnet (i.e., where
                                  prohibitPublicIpOnVnic=true in the Subnet),
                                  then no public IP address is assigned. If not
                                  set and the subnet is public
                                  (prohibitPublicIpOnVnic=false), then a public
                                  IP address is assigned. If set to true and
                                  prohibitPublicIpOnVnic=true, an error is
                                  returned.
  --private-ip TEXT               A private IP address of your choice to assign
                                  to the default VNIC attached to this instance.
                                  Must be an available IP address within the
                                  subnet's CIDR. If no value is specified, a
                                  private IP address from the subnet will be
                                  automatically assigned.
  --skip-source-dest-check BOOLEAN
                                  Indicates whether Source/Destination check is
                                  disabled on the VNIC. Defaults to `false`, in
                                  which case we enable Source/Destination check
                                  on the VNIC.
  --user-data-file FILENAME       A file containing data that Cloud-Init can use
                                  to run custom scripts or provide custom Cloud-
                                  Init configuration. This parameter is a
                                  convenience wrapper around the 'user_data'
                                  field of the --metadata parameter.  Populating
                                  both values in the same call will result in an
                                  error. For more info see Cloud-Init

                                  to be included in the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
                                  file for the default user on the instance. Use
                                  a newline character to separate multiple keys.
                                  The SSH keys must be in the format necessary
                                  for the authorized_keys file. This parameter
                                  is a convenience wrapper around the
                                  'ssh_authorized_keys' field of the --metadata
                                  parameter. Populating both values in the same
                                  call will result in an error. For more info

  --source-boot-volume-id TEXT    The OCID of the boot volume used to boot the
                                  instance. This is a shortcut for specifying a
                                  boot volume source via the --source-details
                                  complex JSON parameter. If this parameter is
                                  provided, you cannot provide the --source-
                                  details or --image-id parameters.
  --boot-volume-size-in-gbs INTEGER
                                  The size of the boot volume in GBs. Minimum
                                  value is 50 GB and maximum value is 16384 GB
                                  (16TB). This is a shortcut for specifying a

  --sort-by [TIMECREATED|DISPLAYNAME]
                                  The field to sort by. You can provide one sort
                                  order (`sortOrder`). Default order for
                                  TIMECREATED is descending. Default order for
                                  DISPLAYNAME is ascending. The DISPLAYNAME sort
                                  order is case sensitive.

                                  Domain, the resources are grouped by
                                  Availability Domain, then sorted.
  --sort-order [ASC|DESC]         The sort order to use, either ascending
                                  (`ASC`) or descending (`DESC`). The

$ oci compute instance terminate --help
Usage: oci compute instance terminate [OPTIONS]

  Terminates the specified instance. Any attached VNICs and volumes are
  automatically detached when the instance terminates.

  To preserve the boot volume associated with the instance, specify `true` for
  `PreserveBootVolumeQueryParam`. To delete the boot volume when the instance
  is deleted, specify `false` or do not specify a value for
  `PreserveBootVolumeQueryParam`.

  This is an asynchronous operation. The instance's `lifecycleState` will
  change to TERMINATING temporarily until the instance is completely removed.

Options:
  --instance-id TEXT              The OCID of the instance. [required]
  --if-match TEXT                 For optimistic concurrency control. In the PUT

                                  resource.  The resource will be updated or
                                  deleted only if the etag you provide matches
                                  the resource's current etag value.
  --preserve-boot-volume BOOLEAN  Specifies whether to delete or preserve the
                                  boot volume when terminating an instance. The
                                  default value is false.

  --if-unmodified-since TEXT  The `If-Unmodified-Since` header field makes the
                              request method conditional on the selected
                              representation's last modification date being
                              earlier than or equal to the date provided in the
                              field-value.  This field accomplishes the same
                              purpose as If-Match for cases where the user agent
                              does not have an entity-tag for the
                              representation.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
$ oci fs export --help
Usage: oci fs export [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  A file system and the path that you can use to mount it. Each export
  resource belongs to exactly one export set.

  The export's path attribute is not a path in the referenced file system, but
  the value used by clients for the path component of the remotetarget
  argument when mounting the file system.

  The path must start with a slash (/) followed by a sequence of zero or more
  slash-separated path elements. For any two export resources associated with
  the same export set, except those in a 'DELETED' state, the path element
  sequence for the first export resource can't contain the complete path
  element sequence of the second export resource.

  For example, the following are acceptable:

    * /foo and /bar   * /foo1 and /foo2   * /foo and /foo1

  The following examples are not acceptable:   * /foo and /foo/bar   * / and
  /foo

  Paths may not end in a slash (/). No path element can be a period (.) or two
  periods in sequence (..). All path elements must be 255 bytes or less.

  No two non-'DELETED' export resources in the same export set can reference
  the same file system.

$ oci fs file-system --help
Usage: oci fs file-system [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  An NFS file system. To allow access to a file system, add it to an export
  set and associate the export set with a mount target. The same file system
  can be in multiple export sets and associated with multiple mount targets.

  To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy.
  If you're not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you're an
  administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see [Getting
  Started with Policies].

$ oci fs file-system create --help
Usage: oci fs file-system create [OPTIONS]

  Creates a new file system in the specified compartment and availability
  domain. Instances can mount file systems in another availability domain, but
  doing so might increase latency when compared to mounting instances in the
  same availability domain.

  After you create a file system, you can associate it with a mount target.
  Instances can then mount the file system by connecting to the mount target's
  IP address. You can associate a file system with more than one mount target
  at a time.

  For information about access control and compartments, see [Overview of the
  IAM Service].

  For information about availability domains, see [Regions and Availability
  Domains]. To get a list of availability domains, use the
  `ListAvailabilityDomains` operation in the Identity and Access Management
  Service API.

  All Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources, including file systems, get an
  Oracle-assigned, unique ID called an Oracle Cloud Identifier (OCID).  When
  you create a resource, you can find its OCID in the response. You can also
  retrieve a resource's OCID by using a List API operation on that resource
  type or by viewing the resource in the Console.

$ oci fs mount-target create --help
Usage: oci fs mount-target create [OPTIONS]

  Creates a new mount target in the specified compartment and subnet. You can
  associate a file system with a mount target only when they exist in the same
  availability domain. Instances can connect to mount targets in another
  availablity domain, but you might see higher latency than with instances in
  the same availability domain as the mount target.

  Mount targets have one or more private IP addresses that you can provide as
  the host portion of remote target parameters in client mount commands. These
  private IP addresses are listed in the privateIpIds property of the mount
  target and are highly available. Mount targets also consume additional IP
  addresses in their subnet.

  For information about access control and compartments, see [Overview of the
  IAM Service].

  For information about availability domains, see [Regions and Availability
  Domains]. To get a list of availability domains, use the
  `ListAvailabilityDomains` operation in the Identity and Access Management
  Service API.

  All Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Services resources, including mount targets,
  get an Oracle-assigned, unique ID called an Oracle Cloud Identifier (OCID).
  When you create a resource, you can find its OCID in the response. You can
  also retrieve a resource's OCID by using a List API operation on that
  resource type, or by viewing the resource in the Console.

Options:
  --availability-domain TEXT      The availability domain in which to create the

$ oci iam compartment --help
Usage: oci iam compartment [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  A collection of related resources. Compartments are a fundamental component
  of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure for organizing and isolating your cloud
  resources. You use them to clearly separate resources for the purposes of
  measuring usage and billing, access (through the use of IAM Service
  policies), and isolation (separating the resources for one project or
  business unit from another). A common approach is to create a compartment
  for each major part of your organization. For more information, see
  [Overview of the IAM Service] and also [Setting Up Your Tenancy].

  To place a resource in a compartment, simply specify the compartment ID in
  the "Create" request object when initially creating the resource. For
  example, to launch an instance into a particular compartment, specify that
  compartment's OCID in the `LaunchInstance` request. You can't move an
  existing resource from one compartment to another.

  To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy.
  If you're not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you're an
  administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see [Getting
  Started with Policies].

$ oci iam compartment create --help
Usage: oci iam compartment create [OPTIONS]

  Creates a new compartment in your tenancy.

  **Important:** Compartments cannot be deleted.

  You must specify your tenancy's OCID as the compartment ID in the request
  object. Remember that the tenancy is simply the root compartment. For
  information about OCIDs, see [Resource Identifiers].

  You must also specify a *name* for the compartment, which must be unique
  across all compartments in your tenancy. You can use this name or the OCID
  when writing policies that apply to the compartment. For more information
  about policies, see [How Policies Work].

  You must also specify a *description* for the compartment (although it can
  be an empty string). It does not have to be unique, and you can change it
  anytime with [UpdateCompartment].

  After you send your request, the new object's `lifecycleState` will
  temporarily be CREATING. Before using the object, first make sure its
  `lifecycleState` has changed to ACTIVE.

Options:
  -c, --compartment-id TEXT       The OCID of the tenancy containing the
                                  compartment. [required]

                                  creation. The name must be unique across all
                                  compartments in the tenancy. [required]
  --description TEXT              The description you assign to the compartment
                                  during creation. Does not have to be unique,
                                  and it's changeable. [required]

$ oci iam compartment get --help
Usage: oci iam compartment get [OPTIONS]

  Gets the specified compartment's information.

  This operation does not return a list of all the resources inside the
  compartment. There is no single API operation that does that. Compartments
  can contain multiple types of resources (instances, block storage volumes,
  etc.). To find out what's in a compartment, you must call the "List"
  operation for each resource type and specify the compartment's OCID as a
  query parameter in the request. For example, call the [ListInstances]
  operation in the Cloud Compute Service or the [ListVolumes] operation in
  Cloud Block Storage.

  A `CustomerSecretKey` is an Oracle-provided key for using the Object Storage
  Service's [Amazon S3 compatible API]. A user can have up to two secret keys
  at a time.

  **Note:** The secret key is always an Oracle-generated string; you can't
  change it to a string of your choice.

$ oci iam customer-secret-key create --help
Usage: oci iam customer-secret-key create [OPTIONS]

  Creates a new secret key for the specified user. Secret keys are used for
  authentication with the Object Storage Service's Amazon S3 compatible API.
  For information, see [Managing User Credentials].

  You must specify a *description* for the secret key (although it can be an
  empty string). It does not have to be unique, and you can change it anytime
  with [UpdateCustomerSecretKey].

  Every user has permission to create a secret key for *their own user ID*. An
  administrator in your organization does not need to write a policy to give
  users this ability. To compare, administrators who have permission to the
  tenancy can use this operation to create a secret key for any user,
  including themselves.

$ oci iam dynamic-group --help
Usage: oci iam dynamic-group [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  An dynamic group defines a matching rule. Every bare metal/vm instance is
  deployed with an instance certificate. The certificate contains metadata
  about the instance. It contains the instance OCID and the compartment OCID,
  along with a few other optional properties. When an API call is made using
  this instance certificate as the authenticator, the certificate may be
  matched to one or multiple dynamic groups. Depending on policies written
  against these dynamic groups, the instance will get access to that API.

  This works like regular user/group memebership. But in that case the
  membership is a static relationship, whereas in dynamic group, the
  membership of an instance certificate to dynamic groups are determined
  during runtime.

Commands:
  create  Creates a new dynamic group in your tenancy.

$ oci iam dynamic-group create --help
Usage: oci iam dynamic-group create [OPTIONS]

  Creates a new dynamic group in your tenancy.

  You must specify your tenancy's OCID as the compartment ID in the request
  object (remember that the tenancy is simply the root compartment). Notice
  that IAM resources (users, groups, compartments, and some policies) reside
  within the tenancy itself, unlike cloud resources such as compute instances,
  which typically reside within compartments inside the tenancy. For
  information about OCIDs, see [Resource Identifiers].

  You must also specify a *name* for the dynamic group, which must be unique
  across all dynamic groups in your tenancy, and cannot be changed. Note that
  this name has to be also unique accross all groups in your tenancy. You can
  use this name or the OCID when writing policies that apply to the dynamic
  group. For more information about policies, see [How Policies Work].

  You must also specify a *description* for the dynamic group (although it can
  be an empty string). It does not have to be unique, and you can change it
  anytime with [UpdateDynamicGroup].

  After you send your request, the new object's `lifecycleState` will
  temporarily be CREATING. Before using the object, first make sure its
  `lifecycleState` has changed to ACTIVE.

Options:
  -c, --compartment-id TEXT       The OCID of the tenancy containing the group.

$ oci iam group --help
Usage: oci iam group [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  A collection of users who all need the same type of access to a particular
  set of resources or compartment. For conceptual information about groups and
  other IAM Service components, see [Overview of the IAM Service].

  If you're federating with an identity provider (IdP), you need to create
  mappings between the groups defined in the IdP and groups you define in the
  IAM service. For more information, see [Identity Providers and Federation].
  Also see [IdentityProvider] and [IdpGroupMapping].

  To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy.
  If you're not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you're an
  administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see [Getting
  Started with Policies].

Options:
  -?, -h, --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  add-user     Adds the specified user to the specified...
  create       Creates a new group in your tenancy.
  delete       Deletes the specified group.
  get          Gets the specified group's information.
  list         Lists the groups in your tenancy.
  list-users   Lists the users in the specified group.

$ oci iam group add-user --help
Usage: oci iam group add-user [OPTIONS]

  Adds the specified user to the specified group.

Options:
  --user-id TEXT    The OCID of the user. [required]
  --group-id TEXT   The OCID of the group. [required]
  --from-json TEXT  Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a
                    file.
                    
                    Options can still be provided on the command line. If

$ oci iam group create --help
Usage: oci iam group create [OPTIONS]

  Creates a new group in your tenancy.

  You must specify your tenancy's OCID as the compartment ID in the request
  object (remember that the tenancy is simply the root compartment). Notice
  that IAM resources (users, groups, compartments, and some policies) reside
  within the tenancy itself, unlike cloud resources such as compute instances,
  which typically reside within compartments inside the tenancy. For
  information about OCIDs, see [Resource Identifiers].

  You must also specify a *name* for the group, which must be unique across
  all groups in your tenancy and cannot be changed. You can use this name or
  the OCID when writing policies that apply to the group. For more information
  about policies, see [How Policies Work].

  You must also specify a *description* for the group (although it can be an
  empty string). It does not have to be unique, and you can change it anytime
  with [UpdateGroup].

  After you send your request, the new object's `lifecycleState` will
  temporarily be CREATING. Before using the object, first make sure its
  `lifecycleState` has changed to ACTIVE.

  After creating the group, you need to put users in it and write policies for
  it. See [AddUserToGroup] and [CreatePolicy].

Options:
  -c, --compartment-id TEXT       The OCID of the tenancy containing the group.
                                  [required]
  --name TEXT                     The name you assign to the group during
                                  creation. The name must be unique across all
                                  groups in the tenancy and cannot be changed.
                                  [required]
  --description TEXT              The description you assign to the group during
                                  creation. Does not have to be unique, and it's
                                  changeable. [required]

$ oci iam policy --help
Usage: oci iam policy [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  A document that specifies the type of access a group has to the resources in
  a compartment. For information about policies and other IAM Service
  components, see [Overview of the IAM Service]. If you're new to policies,
  see [Getting Started with Policies].

  The word "policy" is used by people in different ways:

    * An individual statement written in the policy language   * A collection
    of statements in a single, named "policy" document (which has an Oracle
    Cloud ID (OCID) assigned to it)   * The overall body of policies your
    organization uses to control access to resources

  To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy.
  If you're not authorized, talk to an administrator.

Options:
  -?, -h, --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  create  Creates a new policy in the specified...
  delete  Deletes the specified policy.
  get     Gets the specified policy's information.
  list    Lists the policies in the specified...
  update  Updates the specified policy.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
$ oci iam policy create --help
Usage: oci iam policy create [OPTIONS]

  Creates a new policy in the specified compartment (either the tenancy or
  another of your compartments). If you're new to policies, see [Getting
  Started with Policies].

  You must specify a *name* for the policy, which must be unique across all
  policies in your tenancy and cannot be changed.

  You must also specify a *description* for the policy (although it can be an
  empty string). It does not have to be unique, and you can change it anytime
  with [UpdatePolicy].

  You must specify one or more policy statements in the statements array. For
  information about writing policies, see [How Policies Work] and [Common
  Policies].

  After you send your request, the new object's `lifecycleState` will
  temporarily be CREATING. Before using the object, first make sure its
  `lifecycleState` has changed to ACTIVE.

  New policies take effect typically within 10 seconds.

Options:
  -c, --compartment-id TEXT       The OCID of the compartment containing the
                                  policy (either the tenancy or another

$ oci iam policy list --help
Usage: oci iam policy list [OPTIONS]

  Lists the policies in the specified compartment (either the tenancy or
  another of your compartments). See [Where to Get the Tenancy's OCID and
  User's OCID].

  To determine which policies apply to a particular group or compartment, you
  must view the individual statements inside all your policies. There isn't a
  way to automatically obtain that information via the API.

Options:
  -c, --compartment-id TEXT  The OCID of the compartment (remember that the
                             tenancy is simply the root compartment). [required]
  --page TEXT                The value of the `opc-next-page` response header
                             from the previous "List" call.
  --limit INTEGER            The maximum number of items to return in a
                             paginated "List" call.
  --all                      Fetches all pages of results. If you provide this
                             option, then you cannot provide the --limit option.
  --page-size INTEGER        When fetching results, the number of results to
                             fetch per call. Only valid when used with --all or
                             --limit, and ignored otherwise.
  --from-json TEXT           Provide input to this command as a JSON document

  statements themselves.

  Policy changes take effect typically within 10 seconds.

Options:
  --policy-id TEXT              The OCID of the policy. [required]
  --description TEXT            The description you assign to the policy. Does
                                not have to be unique, and it's changeable.
  --statements TEXT             A JSON array of policy statements written in the
                                policy language. See [How Policies Work] and
                                [Common Policies]. Example: '["statement
                                1","statement 2"]' (The single quotes are
                                required.)
  --version-date TEXT           The version of the policy. If set to an empty

                                authorization, the policy will be evaluated
                                according to the current behavior of the
                                services at that moment. If set to a particular
                                date (YYYY-MM-DD), the policy will be evaluated
                                according to the behavior of the services on
                                that date.

                                or DELETE call for a resource, set the `if-
                                match` parameter to the value of the etag from a
                                previous GET or POST response for that resource.
                                The resource will be updated or deleted only if
                                the etag you provide matches the resource's
                                current etag value.

$ oci iam tag-namespace create --help
Usage: oci iam tag-namespace create [OPTIONS]

  Creates a new tag namespace in the specified compartment.

  You must specify the compartment ID in the request object (remember that the
  tenancy is simply the root compartment).

  You must also specify a *name* for the namespace, which must be unique
  across all namespaces in your tenancy and cannot be changed. The name can
  contain any ASCII character except the space (_) or period (.). Names are
  case insensitive. That means, for example, "myNamespace" and "mynamespace"
  are not allowed in the same tenancy. Once you created a namespace, you
  cannot change the name. If you specify a name that's already in use in the
  tenancy, a 409 error is returned.

  You must also specify a *description* for the namespace. It does not have to
  be unique, and you can change it with [UpdateTagNamespace].

  Tag namespaces cannot be deleted, but they can be retired. See [Retiring Key
  Definitions and Namespace Definitions] for more information.

  Retire the namespace, all the contained tags and the related rules.
  Reactivating a namespace  will not reactivate any tag definition that is
  retired when the namespace was retired. They will have to be individually
  reactivated *after* the namespace is reactivated. You can't add a namespace
  with the same name as a retired namespace in the same tenant.

Options:
  --tag-namespace-id TEXT  The OCID of the tag namespace. [required]
  --from-json TEXT         Provide input to this command as a JSON document from
                           a file.
                           
                           Options can still be provided on the command
                           line. If an option exists in both the JSON document
                           and the command line then the command line specified
                           value will be used

$ oci iam user --help
Usage: oci iam user [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  An individual employee or system that needs to manage or use your company's
  Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources. Users might need to launch instances,
  manage remote disks, work with your cloud network, etc. Users have one or
  more IAM Service credentials ([ApiKey], [UIPassword], and [SwiftPassword]).
  For more information, see [User Credentials]). End users of your application
  are not typically IAM Service users. For conceptual information about users
  and other IAM Service components, see [Overview of the IAM Service].

  These users are created directly within the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure
  system, via the IAM service. They are different from *federated users*, who
  authenticate themselves to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console via an
  identity provider. For more information, see [Identity Providers and
  Federation].

  To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy.
  If you're not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you're an
  administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see [Getting
  Started with Policies].

$ oci iam user api-key --help
Usage: oci iam user api-key [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  A PEM-format RSA credential for securing requests to the Oracle Cloud
  Infrastructure REST API. Also known as an *API signing key*. Specifically,
  this is the public key from the key pair. The private key remains with the
  user calling the API. For information about generating a key pair in the
  required PEM format, see [Required Keys and OCIDs].

  **Important:** This is **not** the SSH key for accessing compute instances.

  Each user can have a maximum of three API signing keys.

  For more information about user credentials, see [User Credentials].

$ oci iam user api-key delete --help
Usage: oci iam user api-key delete [OPTIONS]

  Deletes the specified API signing key for the specified user.

  Every user has permission to use this operation to delete a key for *their
  own user ID*. An administrator in your organization does not need to write a
  policy to give users this ability. To compare, administrators who have
  permission to the tenancy can use this operation to delete a key for any
  user, including themselves.

Options:
  --user-id TEXT      The OCID of the user. [required]
  --fingerprint TEXT  The key's fingerprint. [required]
  --if-match TEXT     For optimistic concurrency control. In the PUT or DELETE
                      call for a resource, set the `if-match` parameter to the
                      value of the etag from a previous GET or POST response for
                      that resource.  The resource will be updated or deleted
                      only if the etag you provide matches the resource's
                      current etag value.
  --force             Perform deletion without prompting for confirmation.
  --from-json TEXT    Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a

$ oci iam user api-key list --help
Usage: oci iam user api-key list [OPTIONS]

  Lists the API signing keys for the specified user. A user can have a maximum
  of three keys.

  Every user has permission to use this API call for *their own user ID*.  An
  administrator in your organization does not need to write a policy to give
  users this ability.

Options:

$ oci iam user api-key upload --help
Usage: oci iam user api-key upload [OPTIONS]

  Uploads an API signing key for the specified user.

  Every user has permission to use this operation to upload a key for *their
  own user ID*. An administrator in your organization does not need to write a
  policy to give users this ability. To compare, administrators who have
  permission to the tenancy can use this operation to upload a key for any
  user, including themselves.

  **Important:** Even though you have permission to upload an API key, you
  might not yet have permission to do much else. If you try calling an
  operation unrelated to your own credential management (e.g., `ListUsers`,
  `LaunchInstance`) and receive an "unauthorized" error, check with an
  administrator to confirm which IAM Service group(s) you're in and what
  access you have. Also confirm you're working in the correct compartment.

  After you send your request, the new object's `lifecycleState` will
  temporarily be CREATING. Before using the object, first make sure its
  `lifecycleState` has changed to ACTIVE.

Options:
  --user-id TEXT    The OCID of the user. [required]
  --key TEXT        The public key.  Must be an RSA key in PEM format.
                    [required]
  --from-json TEXT  Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
$ oci iam user create --help
Usage: oci iam user create [OPTIONS]

  Creates a new user in your tenancy. For conceptual information about users,
  your tenancy, and other IAM Service components, see [Overview of the IAM
  Service].

  You must specify your tenancy's OCID as the compartment ID in the request
  object (remember that the tenancy is simply the root compartment). Notice
  that IAM resources (users, groups, compartments, and some policies) reside
  within the tenancy itself, unlike cloud resources such as compute instances,
  which typically reside within compartments inside the tenancy. For
  information about OCIDs, see [Resource Identifiers].

  You must also specify a *name* for the user, which must be unique across all
  users in your tenancy and cannot be changed. Allowed characters: No spaces.
  Only letters, numerals, hyphens, periods, underscores, +, and @. If you
  specify a name that's already in use, you'll get a 409 error. This name will
  be the user's login to the Console. You might want to pick a name that your
  company's own identity system (e.g., Active Directory, LDAP, etc.) already
  uses. If you delete a user and then create a new user with the same name,
  they'll be considered different users because they have different OCIDs.

  You must also specify a *description* for the user (although it can be an
  empty string). It does not have to be unique, and you can change it anytime
  with [UpdateUser]. You can use the field to provide the user's full name, a
  description, a nickname, or other information to generally identify the
  user.

  After you send your request, the new object's `lifecycleState` will
  temporarily be CREATING. Before using the object, first make sure its
  `lifecycleState` has changed to ACTIVE.

  A new user has no permissions until you place the user in one or more groups
  (see [AddUserToGroup]). If the user needs to access the Console, you need to
  provide the user a password (see [CreateOrResetUIPassword]). If the user
  needs to access the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure REST API, you need to upload
  a public API signing key for that user (see [Required Keys and OCIDs] and
  also [UploadApiKey]).

  **Important:** Make sure to inform the new user which compartment(s) they
  have access to.

Options:
  -c, --compartment-id TEXT       The OCID of the tenancy containing the user.
                                  [required]
  --name TEXT                     The name you assign to the user during
                                  creation. This is the user's login for the
                                  Console. The name must be unique across all
                                  users in the tenancy and cannot be changed.
                                  [required]
  --description TEXT              The description you assign to the user during
                                  creation. Does not have to be unique, and it's
                                  changeable. [required]
  --freeform-tags COMPLEX TYPE    Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is
                                  a simple key-value pair with no predefined

$ oci iam user swift-password --help
Usage: oci iam user swift-password [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Swift is the OpenStack object storage service. A `SwiftPassword` is an
  Oracle-provided password for using a Swift client with the Oracle Cloud
  Infrastructure Object Storage Service. This password is associated with the
  user's Console login. Swift passwords never expire. A user can have up to
  two Swift passwords at a time.

  **Note:** The password is always an Oracle-generated string; you can't
  change it to a string of your choice.

  For more information, see [Managing User Credentials].

$ oci iam user swift-password create --help
Usage: oci iam user swift-password create [OPTIONS]

  Creates a new Swift password for the specified user. For information about
  what Swift passwords are for, see [Managing User Credentials].

  You must specify a *description* for the Swift password (although it can be
  an empty string). It does not have to be unique, and you can change it
  anytime with [UpdateSwiftPassword].

  Every user has permission to create a Swift password for *their own user
  ID*. An administrator in your organization does not need to write a policy
  to give users this ability. To compare, administrators who have permission
  to the tenancy can use this operation to create a Swift password for any
  user, including themselves.

Options:
  --description TEXT  The description you assign to the Swift password during
                      creation. Does not have to be unique, and it's changeable.

$ oci lb load-balancer --help
Usage: oci lb load-balancer [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  The properties that define a load balancer. For more information, see
  [Managing a Load Balancer].

  To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy.
  If you're not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you're an
  administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see [Getting
  Started with Policies].

  For information about endpoints and signing API requests, see [About the
  API]. For information about available SDKs and tools, see [SDKS and Other
  Tools].

Options:
  -?, -h, --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  create  Creates a new load balancer in the specified...
  delete  Stops a load balancer and removes it from...

$ oci lb load-balancer create --help
Usage: oci lb load-balancer create [OPTIONS]

  Creates a new load balancer in the specified compartment. For general
  information about load balancers, see [Overview of the Load Balancing
  Service].

  For the purposes of access control, you must provide the OCID of the
  compartment where you want the load balancer to reside. Notice that the load
  balancer doesn't have to be in the same compartment as the VCN or backend
  set. If you're not sure which compartment to use, put the load balancer in
  the same compartment as the VCN. For information about access control and
  compartments, see [Overview of the IAM Service].

  You must specify a display name for the load balancer. It does not have to
  be unique, and you can change it.

  For information about Availability Domains, see [Regions and Availability
  Domains]. To get a list of Availability Domains, use the
  `ListAvailabilityDomains` operation in the Identity and Access Management
  Service API.

  All Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources, including load balancers, get an
  Oracle-assigned, unique ID called an Oracle Cloud Identifier (OCID). When
  you create a resource, you can find its OCID in the response. You can also
  retrieve a resource's OCID by using a List API operation on that resource
  type, or by viewing the resource in the Console. Fore more information, see
  [Resource Identifiers].

  After you send your request, the new object's state will temporarily be
  PROVISIONING. Before using the object, first make sure its state has changed
  to RUNNING.

  When you create a load balancer, the system assigns an IP address. To get
  the IP address, use the [GetLoadBalancer] operation.

Options:
  -c, --compartment-id TEXT       The [OCID] of the compartment in which to
                                  create the load balancer. [required]

  --is-private BOOLEAN            Whether the load balancer has a VCN-local
                                  (private) IP address.
                                  
                                  If "true", the service
                                  assigns a private IP address to the load
                                  balancer. The load balancer requires only one
                                  subnet to host both the primary and secondary
                                  load balancers. The private IP address is
                                  local to the subnet. The load balancer is
                                  accessible only from within the VCN that
                                  contains the associated subnet, or as further
                                  restricted by your security list rules. The
                                  load balancer can route traffic to any backend
                                  server that is reachable from the VCN.
                                  
                                  For a
                                  private load balancer, both the primary and
                                  secondary load balancer hosts are within the
                                  same Availability Domain.
                                  
                                  If "false", the
                                  service assigns a public IP address to the
                                  load balancer. A load balancer with a public
                                  IP address requires two subnets, each in a
                                  different Availability Domain. One subnet
                                  hosts the primary load balancer and the other
                                  hosts the secondary (standby) load balancer. A
                                  public load balancer is accessible from the
                                  internet, depending on your VCN's [security
                                  list rules].

                                  or DELETE call for a resource, set the `if-
                                  match` parameter to the value of the etag from
                                  a previous GET or POST response for that
                                  resource.  The resource will be updated or
                                  deleted only if the etag you provide matches
                                  the resource's current etag value.
  --force                         Perform deletion without prompting for
                                  confirmation.

$ oci network drg --help
Usage: oci network drg [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  A Dynamic Routing Gateway (DRG), which is a virtual router that provides a
  path for private network traffic between your VCN and your existing network.
  You use it with other Networking Service components to create an IPSec VPN
  or a connection that uses Oracle Cloud Infrastructure FastConnect. For more
  information, see [Overview of the Networking Service].

  To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy.
  If you're not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you're an
  administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see [Getting
  Started with Policies].

  Represents a router that connects the edge of a VCN with the Internet. For
  an example scenario that uses an Internet Gateway, see [Typical Networking
  Service Scenarios].

  To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy.
  If you're not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you're an
  administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see [Getting
  Started with Policies].

$ oci network internet-gateway create --help
Usage: oci network internet-gateway create [OPTIONS]

  Creates a new Internet Gateway for the specified VCN. For more information,
  see [Connectivity to the Internet].

  For the purposes of access control, you must provide the OCID of the
  compartment where you want the Internet Gateway to reside. Notice that the
  Internet Gateway doesn't have to be in the same compartment as the VCN or
  other Networking Service components. If you're not sure which compartment to
  use, put the Internet Gateway in the same compartment with the VCN. For more
  information about compartments and access control, see [Overview of the IAM
  Service]. For information about OCIDs, see [Resource Identifiers].

  You may optionally specify a *display name* for the Internet Gateway,
  otherwise a default is provided. It does not have to be unique, and you can
  change it. Avoid entering confidential information.

  For traffic to flow between a subnet and an Internet Gateway, you must
  create a route rule accordingly in the subnet's route table (for example,
  0.0.0.0/0 > Internet Gateway). See [UpdateRouteTable].

  You must specify whether the Internet Gateway is enabled when you create it.
  If it's disabled, that means no traffic will flow to/from the internet even
  if there's a route rule that enables that traffic. You can later use
  [UpdateInternetGateway] to easily disable/enable the gateway without
  changing the route rule.

                                  `ListInstances`) let you optionally filter by
                                  Availability Domain if the scope of the
                                  resource type is within a single Availability

                                  operations without specifying an Availability
                                  Domain, the resources are grouped by
                                  Availability Domain, then sorted.
  --sort-order [ASC|DESC]         The sort order to use, either ascending
                                  (`ASC`) or descending (`DESC`). The
                                  DISPLAYNAME sort order is case sensitive.
  --lifecycle-state [PROVISIONING|AVAILABLE|TERMINATING|TERMINATED]
                                  A filter to only return resources that match
                                  the given lifecycle state.  The state value is
                                  case-insensitive.
  --all                           Fetches all pages of results. If you provide

$ oci network ip-sec-connection --help
Usage: oci network ip-sec-connection [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  A connection between a DRG and CPE. This connection consists of multiple
  IPSec tunnels. Creating this connection is one of the steps required when
  setting up an IPSec VPN. For more information, see [Overview of the
  Networking Service].

  To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy.
  If you're not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you're an
  administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see [Getting
  Started with Policies].

$ oci network ip-sec-connection create --help
Usage: oci network ip-sec-connection create [OPTIONS]

  Creates a new IPSec connection between the specified DRG and CPE. For more
  information, see [IPSec VPNs].

  In the request, you must include at least one static route to the CPE object
  (you're allowed a maximum of 10). For example: 10.0.8.0/16.

  For the purposes of access control, you must provide the OCID of the
  compartment where you want the IPSec connection to reside. Notice that the
  IPSec connection doesn't have to be in the same compartment as the DRG, CPE,
  or other Networking Service components. If you're not sure which compartment
  to use, put the IPSec connection in the same compartment as the DRG. For
  more information about compartments and access control, see [Overview of the
  IAM Service]. For information about OCIDs, see [Resource Identifiers].

  You may optionally specify a *display name* for the IPSec connection,
  otherwise a default is provided. It does not have to be unique, and you can
  change it. Avoid entering confidential information.

  After creating the IPSec connection, you need to configure your on-premises
  router with tunnel-specific information returned by
  [GetIPSecConnectionDeviceConfig]. For each tunnel, that operation gives you
  the IP address of Oracle's VPN headend and the shared secret (that is, the
  pre-shared key). For more information, see [Configuring Your On-Premises
  Router for an IPSec VPN].

  To get the status of the tunnels (whether they're up or down), use
  [GetIPSecConnectionDeviceStatus].

Options:
  -c, --compartment-id TEXT       The OCID of the compartment to contain the
                                  IPSec connection. [required]

  --drg-id TEXT                   The OCID of the DRG. [required]
  --static-routes COMPLEX TYPE    Static routes to the CPE. At least one route
                                  must be included. The CIDR must not be a
                                  multicast address or class E address. This
                                  must be provided in JSON format.

$ oci network ip-sec-connection delete --help
Usage: oci network ip-sec-connection delete [OPTIONS]

  Deletes the specified IPSec connection. If your goal is to disable the IPSec
  VPN between your VCN and on-premises network, it's easiest to simply detach
  the DRG but keep all the IPSec VPN components intact. If you were to delete
  all the components and then later need to create an IPSec VPN again, you
  would need to configure your on-premises router again with the new
  information returned from [CreateIPSecConnection].

  This is an asynchronous operation. The connection's `lifecycleState` will
  change to TERMINATING temporarily until the connection is completely
  removed.

Options:
  --ipsc-id TEXT                  The OCID of the IPSec connection. [required]
  --if-match TEXT                 For optimistic concurrency control. In the PUT

                                  match` parameter to the value of the etag from
                                  a previous GET or POST response for that
                                  resource.  The resource will be updated or
                                  deleted only if the etag you provide matches
                                  the resource's current etag value.
  --force                         Perform deletion without prompting for

$ oci network local-peering-gateway --help
Usage: oci network local-peering-gateway [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  A local peering gateway (LPG) is an object on a VCN that lets that VCN peer
  with another VCN in the same region. *Peering* means that the two VCNs can
  communicate using private IP addresses, but without the traffic traversing
  the internet or routing through your on-premises network. For more
  information, see [VCN Peering].

  To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy.
  If you're not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you're an
  administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see [Getting
  Started with Policies].

$ oci network local-peering-gateway connect --help
Usage: oci network local-peering-gateway connect [OPTIONS]

  Connects this local peering gateway (LPG) to another one in the same region.

  This operation must be called by the VCN administrator who is designated as
  the *requestor* in the peering relationship. The *acceptor* must implement
  an Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy that gives the requestor
  permission to connect to LPGs in the acceptor's compartment. Without that
  permission, this operation will fail. For more information, see [VCN
  Peering].

$ oci network private-ip --help
Usage: oci network private-ip [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  A *private IP* is a conceptual term that refers to a private IP address and
  related properties. The `privateIp` object is the API representation of a
  private IP.

  Each instance has a *primary private IP* that is automatically created and
  assigned to the primary VNIC during instance launch. If you add a secondary
  VNIC to the instance, it also automatically gets a primary private IP. You
  can't remove a primary private IP from its VNIC. The primary private IP is
  automatically deleted when the VNIC is terminated.

  You can add *secondary private IPs* to a VNIC after it's created. For more
  information, see the `privateIp` operations and also [IP Addresses].

  **Note:** Only [ListPrivateIps] and [GetPrivateIp] work with *primary*
  private IPs. To create and update primary private IPs, you instead work with
  instance and VNIC operations. For example, a primary private IP's properties
  come from the values you specify in [CreateVnicDetails] when calling either
  [LaunchInstance] or [AttachVnic]. To update the hostname for a primary
  private IP, you use [UpdateVnic].

  To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy.
  If you're not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you're an
  administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see [Getting
  Started with Policies].

$ oci network private-ip delete --help
Usage: oci network private-ip delete [OPTIONS]

  Unassigns and deletes the specified private IP. You must specify the
  object's OCID. The private IP address is returned to the subnet's pool of
  available addresses.

  This operation cannot be used with primary private IPs, which are
  automatically unassigned and deleted when the VNIC is terminated.

  **Important:** If a secondary private IP is the [target of a route rule],
  unassigning it from the VNIC causes that route rule to blackhole and the
  traffic will be dropped.

Options:
  --private-ip-id TEXT  The OCID of the private IP. [required]
  --if-match TEXT       For optimistic concurrency control. In the PUT or DELETE
                        call for a resource, set the `if-match` parameter to the
                        value of the etag from a previous GET or POST response
                        for that resource.  The resource will be updated or
                        deleted only if the etag you provide matches the
                        resource's current etag value.
  --force               Perform deletion without prompting for confirmation.
  --from-json TEXT      Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a
                        file.
                        
                        Options can still be provided on the command
                        line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and
                        the command line then the command line specified value

$ oci network private-ip get --help
Usage: oci network private-ip get [OPTIONS]

  Gets the specified private IP. You must specify the object's OCID.
  Alternatively, you can get the object by using [ListPrivateIps] with the
  private IP address (for example, 10.0.3.3) and subnet OCID.

Options:
  --private-ip-id TEXT  The OCID of the private IP. [required]
  --from-json TEXT      Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a

$ oci network private-ip list --help
Usage: oci network private-ip list [OPTIONS]

  Lists the [PrivateIp] objects based on one of these filters:

      - Subnet OCID.
      - VNIC OCID.
      - Both private IP address and subnet OCID: This lets you get a `privateIP` object
        based on its private IP address (for example, 10.0.3.3)  and not its OCID.
        For comparison, [GetPrivateIp] requires the OCID.

  If you're listing all the private IPs associated with a given subnet or
  VNIC, the response includes both primary and secondary private IPs.

Options:
  --limit INTEGER      The maximum number of items to return in a paginated
                       "List" call.
                       
                       Example: `500`
  --page TEXT          The value of the `opc-next-page` response header from the
                       previous "List" call.
  --ip-address TEXT    An IP address.
                       
                       Example: `10.0.3.3`
  --subnet-id TEXT     The OCID of the subnet.
  --vnic-id TEXT       The OCID of the VNIC.
  --all                Fetches all pages of results. If you provide this option,
                       then you cannot provide the --limit option.
  --page-size INTEGER  When fetching results, the number of results to fetch per
                       call. Only valid when used with --all or --limit, and
                       ignored otherwise.

$ oci network private-ip update --help
Usage: oci network private-ip update [OPTIONS]

  Updates the specified private IP. You must specify the object's OCID. Use
  this operation if you want to:

      - Change the display name for a secondary private IP.
      - Change the hostname for a secondary private IP.

  To move a secondary private IP to another VNIC, use the `bcms network vnic
  assign-private-ip` command with the --unassign-if-already-assigned switch.

  This operation cannot be used with primary private IPs. To update the
  hostname for the primary IP on a VNIC, use [UpdateVnic].

$ oci network public-ip --help
Usage: oci network public-ip [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  A *public IP* is a conceptual term that refers to a public IP address and
  related properties. The `publicIp` object is the API representation of a
  public IP.

  There are two types of public IPs: 1. Ephemeral 2. Reserved

  For more information and comparison of the two types, see [Public IP
  Addresses].

Options:
  -?, -h, --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  create  Creates a public IP.
  delete  Unassigns and deletes the specified public IP...
  get     Gets the specified public IP object.
  list    Lists either the ephemeral or reserved...
  update  Updates the specified public IP.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
$ oci network public-ip create --help
Usage: oci network public-ip create [OPTIONS]

  Creates a public IP. Use the `lifetime` property to specify whether it's an
  ephemeral or reserved public IP. For information about limits on how many
  you can create, see [Public IP Addresses].

  * **For an ephemeral public IP:** You must also specify a `privateIpId` with
  the OCID of the primary private IP you want to assign the public IP to. The
  public IP is created in the same Availability Domain as the private IP. An
  ephemeral public IP must always be assigned to a private IP, and only to the
  *primary* private IP on a VNIC, not a secondary private IP.

  * **For a reserved public IP:** You may also optionally assign the public IP
  to a private IP by specifying `privateIpId`. Or you can later assign the
  public IP with [UpdatePublicIp].

  **Note:** When assigning a public IP to a private IP, the private IP must
  not already have a public IP with `lifecycleState` = ASSIGNING or ASSIGNED.
  If it does, an error is returned.

  Also, for reserved public IPs, the optional assignment part of this
  operation is asynchronous. Poll the public IP's `lifecycleState` to
  determine if the assignment succeeded.

Options:
  -c, --compartment-id TEXT       The OCID of the compartment to contain the
                                  public IP. For ephemeral public IPs, you must
                                  set this to the private IP's compartment OCID.
                                  [required]
  --lifetime [EPHEMERAL|RESERVED]
                                  Defines when the public IP is deleted and
                                  released back to the Oracle Cloud
                                  Infrastructure public IP pool. For more

                                  public IP because it must always be assigned
                                  to a private IP (specifically a *primary*
                                  private IP).

                                  IP. If you don't provide it, the public IP is
                                  created but not assigned to a private IP. You
                                  can later assign the public IP with

$ oci network public-ip delete --help
Usage: oci network public-ip delete [OPTIONS]

  Unassigns and deletes the specified public IP (either ephemeral or
  reserved). You must specify the object's OCID. The public IP address is
  returned to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure public IP pool.

  For an assigned reserved public IP, the initial unassignment portion of this
  operation is asynchronous. Poll the public IP's `lifecycleState` to
  determine if the operation succeeded.

  If you want to simply unassign a reserved public IP and return it to your
  pool of reserved public IPs, instead use [UpdatePublicIp].

Options:
  --public-ip-id TEXT             The OCID of the public IP. [required]

$ oci network public-ip update --help
Usage: oci network public-ip update [OPTIONS]

  Updates the specified public IP. You must specify the object's OCID. Use
  this operation if you want to:

  * Assign a reserved public IP in your pool to a private IP. * Move a
  reserved public IP to a different private IP. * Unassign a reserved public
  IP from a private IP (which returns it to your pool of reserved public IPs).
  * Change the display name for a public IP (either ephemeral or reserved).

  Assigning, moving, and unassigning a reserved public IP are asynchronous
  operations. Poll the public IP's `lifecycleState` to determine if the
  operation succeeded.

  **Note:** When moving a reserved public IP, the target private IP must not
  already have a public IP with `lifecycleState` = ASSIGNING or ASSIGNED. If
  it does, an error is returned. Also, the initial unassignment from the
  original private IP always succeeds, but the assignment to the target
  private IP is asynchronous and could fail silently (for example, if the
  target private IP is deleted or has a different public IP assigned to it in
  the interim). If that occurs, the public IP remains unassigned and its
  `lifecycleState` switches to AVAILABLE (it is not reassigned to its original
  private IP). You must poll the public IP's `lifecycleState` to determine if
  the move succeeded.

  Regarding ephemeral public IPs:

  * If you want to assign an ephemeral public IP to a primary private IP, use
  [CreatePublicIp]. * You can't move an ephemeral public IP to a different
  private IP. * If you want to unassign an ephemeral public IP from its
  private IP, use [DeletePublicIp], which unassigns and deletes the ephemeral
  public IP.

  **Note:** If a public IP (either ephemeral or reserved) is assigned to a
  secondary private IP (see [PrivateIp]), and you move that secondary private
  IP to another VNIC, the public IP moves with it.

  **Note:** There's a limit to the number of [public IPs] a VNIC or instance
  can have. If you try to move a reserved public IP to a VNIC or instance that
  has already reached its public IP limit, an error is returned. For
  information about the public IP limits, see [Public IP Addresses].

Options:
  --public-ip-id TEXT             The OCID of the public IP. [required]
  --display-name TEXT             A user-friendly name. Does not have to be
                                  unique, and it's changeable. Avoid entering
                                  confidential information.
  --private-ip-id TEXT            The OCID of the private IP to assign the
                                  public IP to. * If the public IP is already
                                  assigned to a different private IP, it will be
                                  unassigned and then reassigned to the
                                  specified private IP. * If you set this field
                                  to an empty string, the public IP will be
                                  unassigned from the private IP it is currently
                                  assigned to.
  --if-match TEXT                 For optimistic concurrency control. In the PUT
                                  or DELETE call for a resource, set the `if-
                                  match` parameter to the value of the etag from
                                  a previous GET or POST response for that
                                  resource.  The resource will be updated or
                                  deleted only if the etag you provide matches
                                  the resource's current etag value.
  --wait-for-state [PROVISIONING|AVAILABLE|ASSIGNING|ASSIGNED|UNASSIGNING|UNASSIGNED|TERMINATING|TERMINATED]
                                  This operation creates, modifies or deletes a
                                  resource that has a defined lifecycle state.
                                  Specify this option to perform the action and

                                  lifecycle state.
  --max-wait-seconds INTEGER      The maximum time to wait for the resource to
                                  reach the lifecycle state defined by --wait-
                                  for-state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.

$ oci network route-table create --help
Usage: oci network route-table create [OPTIONS]

  Creates a new route table for the specified VCN. In the request you must
  also include at least one route rule for the new route table. For
  information on the number of rules you can have in a route table, see
  [Service Limits]. For general information about route tables in your VCN and
  the types of targets you can use in route rules, see [Route Tables].

  For the purposes of access control, you must provide the OCID of the
  compartment where you want the route table to reside. Notice that the route
  table doesn't have to be in the same compartment as the VCN, subnets, or
  other Networking Service components. If you're not sure which compartment to
  use, put the route table in the same compartment as the VCN. For more
  information about compartments and access control, see [Overview of the IAM
  Service]. For information about OCIDs, see [Resource Identifiers].

  You may optionally specify a *display name* for the route table, otherwise a
  default is provided. It does not have to be unique, and you can change it.
  Avoid entering confidential information.

  change to TERMINATING temporarily until the route table is completely
  removed.

Options:
  --rt-id TEXT                    The OCID of the route table. [required]
  --if-match TEXT                 For optimistic concurrency control. In the PUT
                                  or DELETE call for a resource, set the `if-
                                  match` parameter to the value of the etag from
                                  a previous GET or POST response for that
                                  resource.  The resource will be updated or
                                  deleted only if the etag you provide matches
                                  the resource's current etag value.
  --force                         Perform deletion without prompting for
                                  confirmation.

$ oci network security-list --help
Usage: oci network security-list [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  A set of virtual firewall rules for your VCN. Security lists are configured
  at the subnet level, but the rules are applied to the ingress and egress
  traffic for the individual instances in the subnet. The rules can be
  stateful or stateless. For more information, see [Security Lists].

  **Important:** Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Compute service images
  automatically include firewall rules (for example, Linux iptables, Windows
  firewall). If there are issues with some type of access to an instance, make
  sure both the security lists associated with the instance's subnet and the
  instance's firewall rules are set correctly.

  To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy.
  If you're not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you're an
  administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see [Getting
  Started with Policies].

Options:
  -?, -h, --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  create  Creates a new security list for the specified...
  delete  Deletes the specified security list, but only...
  get     Gets the specified security list's...
  list    Lists the security lists in the specified VCN...

$ oci network security-list create --help
Usage: oci network security-list create [OPTIONS]

  Creates a new security list for the specified VCN. For more information
  about security lists, see [Security Lists]. For information on the number of
  rules you can have in a security list, see [Service Limits].

  For the purposes of access control, you must provide the OCID of the
  compartment where you want the security list to reside. Notice that the
  security list doesn't have to be in the same compartment as the VCN,
  subnets, or other Networking Service components. If you're not sure which
  compartment to use, put the security list in the same compartment as the
  VCN. For more information about compartments and access control, see
  [Overview of the IAM Service]. For information about OCIDs, see [Resource
  Identifiers].

  You may optionally specify a *display name* for the security list, otherwise
  a default is provided. It does not have to be unique, and you can change it.
  Avoid entering confidential information.

$ oci network security-list list --help
Usage: oci network security-list list [OPTIONS]

  Lists the security lists in the specified VCN and compartment.

Options:
  -c, --compartment-id TEXT       The OCID of the compartment. [required]
  --vcn-id TEXT                   The OCID of the VCN. [required]
  --limit INTEGER                 The maximum number of items to return in a
                                  paginated "List" call.
                                  
                                  Example: `500`
  --page TEXT                     The value of the `opc-next-page` response
                                  header from the previous "List" call.
  --display-name TEXT             A filter to return only resources that match
                                  the given display name exactly.
  --sort-by [TIMECREATED|DISPLAYNAME]
                                  The field to sort by. You can provide one sort
                                  order (`sortOrder`). Default order for
                                  TIMECREATED is descending. Default order for
                                  DISPLAYNAME is ascending. The DISPLAYNAME sort
                                  order is case sensitive.
                                  
                                  **Note:** In
                                  general, some "List" operations (for example,
                                  `ListInstances`) let you optionally filter by
                                  Availability Domain if the scope of the
                                  resource type is within a single Availability
                                  Domain. If you call one of these "List"
                                  operations without specifying an Availability
                                  Domain, the resources are grouped by
                                  Availability Domain, then sorted.
  --sort-order [ASC|DESC]         The sort order to use, either ascending
                                  (`ASC`) or descending (`DESC`). The
                                  DISPLAYNAME sort order is case sensitive.
  --lifecycle-state [PROVISIONING|AVAILABLE|TERMINATING|TERMINATED]
                                  A filter to only return resources that match
                                  the given lifecycle state.  The state value is
                                  case-insensitive.
  --all                           Fetches all pages of results. If you provide
                                  this option, then you cannot provide the
                                  --limit option.
  --page-size INTEGER             When fetching results, the number of results
                                  to fetch per call. Only valid when used with
                                  --all or --limit, and ignored otherwise.
  --from-json TEXT                Provide input to this command as a JSON
                                  document from a file.

$ oci network subnet --help
Usage: oci network subnet [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  A logical subdivision of a VCN. Each subnet exists in a single Availability
  Domain and consists of a contiguous range of IP addresses that do not
  overlap with other subnets in the VCN. Example: 172.16.1.0/24. For more
  information, see [Overview of the Networking Service] and [VCNs and
  Subnets].

  To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy.
  If you're not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you're an
  administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see [Getting
  Started with Policies].

Options:
  -?, -h, --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  create  Creates a new subnet in the specified VCN.
  delete  Deletes the specified subnet, but only if...
  get     Gets the specified subnet's information.
  list    Lists the subnets in the specified VCN and...
  update  Updates the specified subnet's display name.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
$ oci network subnet create --help
Usage: oci network subnet create [OPTIONS]

  Creates a new subnet in the specified VCN. You can't change the size of the
  subnet after creation, so it's important to think about the size of subnets
  you need before creating them. For more information, see [VCNs and Subnets].
  For information on the number of subnets you can have in a VCN, see [Service
  Limits].

  For the purposes of access control, you must provide the OCID of the
  compartment where you want the subnet to reside. Notice that the subnet
  doesn't have to be in the same compartment as the VCN, route tables, or
  other Networking Service components. If you're not sure which compartment to
  use, put the subnet in the same compartment as the VCN. For more information
  about compartments and access control, see [Overview of the IAM Service].
  For information about OCIDs, see [Resource Identifiers].

  You may optionally associate a route table with the subnet. If you don't,
  the subnet will use the VCN's default route table. For more information
  about route tables, see [Route Tables].

  You may optionally associate a security list with the subnet. If you don't,
  the subnet will use the VCN's default security list. For more information
  about security lists, see [Security Lists].

  You may optionally associate a set of DHCP options with the subnet. If you
  don't, the subnet will use the VCN's default set. For more information about
  DHCP options, see [DHCP Options].

  You may optionally specify a *display name* for the subnet, otherwise a
  default is provided. It does not have to be unique, and you can change it.
  Avoid entering confidential information.

  You can also add a DNS label for the subnet, which is required if you want
  the Internet and VCN Resolver to resolve hostnames for instances in the
  subnet. For more information, see [DNS in Your Virtual Cloud Network].

                                  This value must
                                  be set if you want to use the Internet and VCN
                                  Resolver to resolve the hostnames of instances
                                  in the subnet. It can only be set if the VCN
                                  itself was created with a DNS label.

  --prohibit-public-ip-on-vnic BOOLEAN
                                  Whether VNICs within this subnet can have
                                  public IP addresses. Defaults to false, which
                                  means VNICs created in this subnet will
                                  automatically be assigned public IP addresses
                                  unless specified otherwise during instance

                                  will use the VCN's default route table.
  --security-list-ids COMPLEX TYPE
                                  OCIDs for the security lists to associate with

                                  with the subnet. Remember that security lists
                                  are associated at the subnet level, but the
                                  rules are applied to the individual VNICs in
                                  the subnet.
                                  This is a complex type whose value

                                  DISPLAYNAME is ascending. The DISPLAYNAME sort
                                  order is case sensitive.
                                  
                                  **Note:** In
                                  general, some "List" operations (for example,
                                  `ListInstances`) let you optionally filter by
                                  Availability Domain if the scope of the
                                  resource type is within a single Availability
                                  Domain. If you call one of these "List"
                                  operations without specifying an Availability
                                  Domain, the resources are grouped by
                                  Availability Domain, then sorted.
  --sort-order [ASC|DESC]         The sort order to use, either ascending
                                  (`ASC`) or descending (`DESC`). The
                                  DISPLAYNAME sort order is case sensitive.
  --lifecycle-state [PROVISIONING|AVAILABLE|TERMINATING|TERMINATED]
                                  A filter to only return resources that match
                                  the given lifecycle state.  The state value is
                                  case-insensitive.
  --all                           Fetches all pages of results. If you provide
                                  this option, then you cannot provide the
                                  --limit option.
  --page-size INTEGER             When fetching results, the number of results
                                  to fetch per call. Only valid when used with
                                  --all or --limit, and ignored otherwise.
  --from-json TEXT                Provide input to this command as a JSON
                                  document from a file.

$ oci network vcn --help
Usage: oci network vcn [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  A Virtual Cloud Network (VCN). For more information, see [Overview of the
  Networking Service].

  To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy.
  If you're not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you're an
  administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see [Getting
  Started with Policies].

Options:
  -?, -h, --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  create  Creates a new Virtual Cloud Network (VCN).
  delete  Deletes the specified VCN.
  get     Gets the specified VCN's information.

  update  Updates the specified VCN's display name.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
$ oci network vcn create --help
Usage: oci network vcn create [OPTIONS]

  Creates a new Virtual Cloud Network (VCN). For more information, see [VCNs
  and Subnets].

  For the VCN you must specify a single, contiguous IPv4 CIDR block. Oracle
  recommends using one of the private IP address ranges specified in [RFC
  1918] (10.0.0.0/8, 172.16/12, and 192.168/16). Example: 172.16.0.0/16. The
  CIDR block can range from /16 to /30, and it must not overlap with your on-
  premises network. You can't change the size of the VCN after creation.

  For the purposes of access control, you must provide the OCID of the
  compartment where you want the VCN to reside. Consult an Oracle Cloud
  Infrastructure administrator in your organization if you're not sure which
  compartment to use. Notice that the VCN doesn't have to be in the same
  compartment as the subnets or other Networking Service components. For more
  information about compartments and access control, see [Overview of the IAM
  Service]. For information about OCIDs, see [Resource Identifiers].

  You may optionally specify a *display name* for the VCN, otherwise a default
  is provided. It does not have to be unique, and you can change it. Avoid
  entering confidential information.

  You can also add a DNS label for the VCN, which is required if you want the
  instances to use the Interent and VCN Resolver option for DNS in the VCN.
  For more information, see [DNS in Your Virtual Cloud Network].

  The VCN automatically comes with a default route table, default security
  list, and default set of DHCP options. The OCID for each is returned in the
  response. You can't delete these default objects, but you can change their
  contents (that is, change the route rules, security list rules, and so on).

  The VCN and subnets you create are not accessible until you attach an
  Internet Gateway or set up an IPSec VPN or FastConnect. For more
  information, see [Overview of the Networking Service].

Options:
  --cidr-block TEXT               The CIDR IP address block of the VCN.
                                  Example: `172.16.0.0/16` [required]
  -c, --compartment-id TEXT       The OCID of the compartment to contain the
                                  VCN. [required]

$ oci network vcn delete --help
Usage: oci network vcn delete [OPTIONS]

  Deletes the specified VCN. The VCN must be empty and have no attached
  gateways. This is an asynchronous operation. The VCN's `lifecycleState` will
  change to TERMINATING temporarily until the VCN is completely removed.

Options:
  --vcn-id TEXT                   The OCID of the VCN. [required]
  --if-match TEXT                 For optimistic concurrency control. In the PUT
                                  or DELETE call for a resource, set the `if-
                                  match` parameter to the value of the etag from
                                  a previous GET or POST response for that
                                  resource.  The resource will be updated or
                                  deleted only if the etag you provide matches
                                  the resource's current etag value.

  automatically created and attached during launch. You can add *secondary
  VNICs* to an instance after it's launched. For more information, see
  [Virtual Network Interface Cards (VNICs)].

  Each VNIC has a *primary private IP* that is automatically assigned during
  launch. You can add *secondary private IPs* to a VNIC after it's created.
  For more information, see [CreatePrivateIp] and [IP Addresses].

  To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy.

                                  `GetObject` and `HeadObject` operations.
  --storage-tier [Standard|Archive]
                                  The type of storage tier of this bucket. A
                                  bucket is set to 'Standard' tier by default,
                                  which means the bucket will be put in the
                                  standard storage tier. When 'Archive' tier
                                  type is set explicitly, the bucket is put in
                                  the Archive Storage tier. The 'storageTier'
                                  property is immutable after bucket is created.
  --freeform-tags COMPLEX TYPE    Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is

$ oci os ns --help
Usage: oci os ns [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  A namespace is a logical entity that serves as a top-level container for all
  buckets and objects, allowing you to control bucket naming within your
  tenancy. Each tenancy is provided one unique and uneditable namespace that
  is global, spanning all regions and compartments. While bucket names must be
  unique within your namespace, bucket names within your namespace can
  duplicate bucket names used in the namespaces of other tenants.

  Namespace metadata stores the compartment assignments for resources created
  by the Amazon S3 Compatibility API and the Swift API. By default, resources
  created by the Amazon S3 Compatibility and Swift APIs are stored in the root
  compartment of the tenancy.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
$ oci os object bulk-delete --help
Usage: oci os object bulk-delete [OPTIONS]

  Deletes all objects in a bucket which match the provided criteria.

  Examples
  ========

  Deleting all objects in the bucket
  ----------------------------------
  oci os object bulk-delete -ns mynamespace -bn mybucket

  Delete all objects that match a given prefix
  --------------------------------------------
  oci os object bulk-delete -ns mynamespace -bn mybucket --prefix level1/level2/ --prefix myprefix

  You can delete all objects that match a given prefix by specifying the --prefix flag. In the above example, "--prefix myprefix" would
  match object names such as myprefix_textfile1.txt, myprefix_myImage.png etc.

  If you have named your objects so that they exist in Object Storage as a hierarchy, e.g. level1/level2/level3/myobject.txt, then you
  can delete objects at a given level (and all sub levels) by specifying a prefix:

  oci os object bulk-delete -ns mynamespace -bn mybucket --prefix level1/level2/

  This will delete all objects of the form level1/level2/<object name>, level1/level2/leve3/<object name>,
  level1/level2/leve3/level4/<object name> etc.

  Limiting deleted objects using a prefix and delimiter
  -----------------------------------------------------
  oci os object bulk-delete -ns mynamespace -bn mybucket --prefix level1/level2/ --delimiter /

  If you have named your objects so that they exist in Object Storage as a hierarchy, e.g. level1/level2/level3/myobject.txt, and you only
  want to delete objects at a given level of the hierarchy, e.g. example everything of the form level1/level2/<object name> but not
  level1/level2/leve3/<object name> or any other sub-levels, you can specify a prefix and delimiter. Currently the only supported delimiter
  is /

  Previewing what would be deleted
  ----------------------------
  oci os object bulk-delete -ns mynamespace -bn mybucket --dry-run
  oci os object bulk-delete -ns mynamespace -bn mybucket --prefix level1/level2/ --dry-run
  oci os object bulk-delete -ns mynamespace -bn mybucket --prefix level1/level2/ --delimiter / --dry-run

  For any bulk-delete command you can get a list of all objects which would be deleted, but without actually deleting them, by using the --dry-run
  flag

  Do not prompt for delete
  ------------------------
  oci os object bulk-delete -ns mynamespace -bn mybucket --force
  oci os object bulk-delete -ns mynamespace -bn mybucket --prefix level1/level2/ --force
  oci os object bulk-delete -ns mynamespace -bn mybucket --prefix level1/level2/ --delimiter / --force

  By default, the bulk-delete command will prompt you prior to deleting objects. To suppress this prompt, pass the --force option.

Options:
  -ns, --namespace TEXT           The top-level namespace used for the request.
                                  [required]
  -bn, --bucket-name TEXT         The name of the bucket. [required]
  --prefix TEXT                   Delete all objects with the given prefix. Omit
                                  this parameter to delete all objects in the
                                  bucket.
  --delimiter TEXT                When this parameter is set, only objects whose
                                  names do not contain the delimiter character
                                  (after an optionally specified prefix) are
                                  deleted. Scanned objects whose names contain
                                  the delimiter have part of their name up to
                                  the last occurrence of the delimiter (after
                                  the optional prefix) returned as a set of
                                  prefixes. Note: Only '/' is a supported
                                  delimiter character at this time.
  --dry-run                       Displays a list of objects which would be
                                  deleted by this command, if it were run
                                  without --dry-run. If --dry-run is passed, no
                                  objects will actually be deleted.
  --force                         Do not ask for confirmation prior to
                                  performing the bulk delete.
  --parallel-operations-count INTEGER
                                  The number of parallel operations to perform.
                                  Decreasing this value will make bulk deletes
                                  less resource intensive but they may take
                                  longer. Increasing this value may improve bulk
                                  delete times, but the upload process will
                                  consume more system resources and network
                                  bandwidth.  [default: 10]
  --include TEXT                  Only delete objects which match the provided
                                  pattern. Patterns are taken relative to the

$ oci os object bulk-download --help
Usage: oci os object bulk-download [OPTIONS]

  Downloads all objects which match the given prefix to a given directory.

  Examples
  ========

  Download all objects in the bucket
  ------------------------------
  oci os object bulk-download -ns mynamespace -bn mybucket --download-dir path/to/download/directory

  Download all objects that match a given prefix
  ----------------------------------------------
  oci os object bulk-download -ns mynamespace -bn mybucket --download-dir path/to/download/directory --prefix myprefix

  You can download all objects that match a given prefix by specifying the --prefix flag. In the above example, "--prefix myprefix" would
  match object names such as myPrefix_textfile1.txt, myPrefix_myImage.png etc.

  If you have named your objects so that they exist in Object Storage as a hierarchy, e.g. level1/level2/level3/myobject.txt, then you
  can download objects at a given level (and all sub levels) by specifying a prefix:

  oci os object bulk-download -ns mynamespace -bn mybucket --download-dir path/to/download/directory --prefix level1/level2/

  This will download all objects of the form level1/level2/<object name>, level1/level2/leve3/<object name>,
  level1/level2/leve3/level4/<object name> etc.

  Limiting downloaded objects using a prefix and delimiter
  --------------------------------------------------------
  oci os object bulk-download -ns mynamespace -bn mybucket --download-dir path/to/download/directory --prefix level1/level2/ --delimiter /

  If you have named your objects so that they exist in Object Storage as a hierarchy, e.g. level1/level2/level3/myobject.txt, and you only
  want to download objects at a given level of the hierarchy, e.g. example everything of the form level1/level2/<object name> but not
  level1/level2/leve3/<object name> or any other sub-levels, you can specify a prefix and delimiter. Currently the only supported delimiter
  is /

  Overwriting or skipping files
  ------------------------------
  oci os object bulk-download -ns mynamespace -bn mybucket --download-dir path/to/download/directory --overwrite
  oci os object bulk-download -ns mynamespace -bn mybucket --download-dir path/to/download/directory --no-overwrite

  If files with the same name as the objects being downloaded already exist in the download directory, you can opt to overwrite them with the
  --overwrite option, or preserve them with the --no-overwrite option.

Options:
  -ns, --namespace TEXT           The top-level namespace used for the request.
                                  [required]
  -bn, --bucket-name TEXT         The name of the bucket. [required]
  --prefix TEXT                   Retrieve all objects with the given prefix.
                                  Omit this parameter to get all objects in the
                                  bucket
  --delimiter TEXT                When this parameter is set, only objects whose
                                  names do not contain the delimiter character
                                  (after an optionally specified prefix) are
                                  returned. Scanned objects whose names contain
                                  the delimiter have part of their name up to
                                  the last occurrence of the delimiter (after
                                  the optional prefix) returned as a set of
                                  prefixes. Note: Only '/' is a supported
                                  delimiter character at this time.
  --download-dir TEXT             The directory where retrieved objects will be
                                  placed as files. This directory will be
                                  created if it does not exist. [required]
  --overwrite                     If a file with the same name as an object
                                  already exists in the download directory,
                                  overwrite it. If neither this flag nor --no-
                                  overwrite is specified, you will be prompted
                                  each time a file would be overwritten.
  --no-overwrite                  If a file with the same name as an object
                                  already exists in the download directory, do
                                  not overwite it. If neither this flag nor
                                  --overwrite is specified, you will be prompted
                                  each time a file would be overwritten
  --parallel-operations-count INTEGER
                                  The number of parallel operations to perform.
                                  Decreasing this value will make bulk downloads
                                  less resource intensive but they may take
                                  longer. Increasing this value may improve bulk
                                  download times, but the upload process will
                                  consume more system resources and network
                                  bandwidth.  [default: 10]
  --multipart-download-threshold INTEGER RANGE
                                  Objects larger than this size (in MiB) will be
                                  downloaded in multiple parts. The minimum
                                  allowable threshold is 128 MiB.
  --part-size INTEGER RANGE       Part size (in MiB) to use when downloading an
                                  object in multiple parts. The minimum
                                  allowable size is 128 MiB.
  --include TEXT                  Only download objects which match the provided
                                  pattern. Patterns are taken relative to the
                                  DOWNLOAD directory. This option can be
                                  provided mulitple times to match on mulitple

$ oci os object bulk-upload --help
Usage: oci os object bulk-upload [OPTIONS]

  Uploads all files in a given directory and all subdirectories.

  Examples
  ========

  Upload all files from a given directory
  -----------------------------------------
  oci os object bulk-upload -ns mynamespace -bn mybucket --src-dir path/to/upload/directory

  Upload all files and prefix the object names in Object Storage
  --------------------------------------------------------------
  oci os object bulk-upload -ns mynamespace -bn mybucket --src-dir path/to/upload/directory --object-prefix my-prefix/

  In the above example command, all files uploaded to Object Storage will have
  their object names prefixed with "my-prefix/". This will allow you to
  further group uploaded files together or potentially avoid name collisions
  when uploading files.

  Forcing object overwrite to resolve object name collision
  ----------------------------------------------------------
  oci os object bulk-upload -ns mynamespace -bn mybucket --src-dir path/to/upload/directory --overwrite

  If a file being uploaded already exists in Object Storage, it can be overwritten without a prompt by
  using the --overwrite flag. Specifying --overwrite will also allow for faster uploads as the CLI will not
  initially check whether or not the files already exist in Object Storage.

  Prevent object overwrite to resolve object name collision
  ----------------------------------------------------------
  oci os object bulk-upload -ns mynamespace -bn mybucket --src-dir path/to/upload/directory --no-overwrite

  If a file being uploaded already exists in Object Storage, it can be preserved (not overwritten) without a
  prompt by using the --no-overwrite flag.

Options:
  -ns, --namespace TEXT           Object Storage namespace. [required]
  -bn, --bucket-name TEXT         The name of the bucket. [required]
  --src-dir TEXT                  The directory which contains files to upload.
                                  Files in the directory and all subdirectories
                                  will be uploaded. [required]
  --object-prefix TEXT            A prefix to apply to the names of all files
                                  being uploaded
  --metadata TEXT                 Arbitrary string keys and values for user-
                                  defined metadata. This will be applied to all
                                  files being uploaded. Must be in JSON format.
                                  Example: '{"key1":"value1","key2":"value2"}'
  --content-type TEXT             The content type to apply to all files being
                                  uploaded.
  --content-language TEXT         The content language to apply to all files
                                  being uploaded.
  --content-encoding TEXT         The content encoding to apply to all files
                                  being uploaded.
  --overwrite                     If a file being uploaded already exists in
                                  Object Storage, overwrite the existing object
                                  in Object Storage without a confirmation
                                  prompt. If neither this flag nor --no-
                                  overwrite is specified, you will be prompted
                                  each time an object would be overwritten.
                                  Specifying this flag will also allow for
                                  faster uploads as the CLI will not initially
                                  check whether or not the files already exist
                                  in Object Storage.
  --no-overwrite                  If a file being uploaded already exists in
                                  Object Storage, do not overwite it. If neither
                                  this flag nor --overwrite is specified, you
                                  will be prompted each time an object would be
                                  overwritten
  --no-multipart                  Do not use multipart uploads to upload the
                                  file in parts. By default files above 128 MiB
                                  will be uploaded in multiple parts, then
                                  combined server-side. This applies to all
                                  files being uploaded
  --part-size INTEGER             Part size (in MiB) to use if uploading via
                                  multipart upload operations. This applies to
                                  all files which will be uploaded in multiple
                                  parts. Part size must be greater than 10 MiB
  --disable-parallel-uploads      [DEPRECATED] This option is no longer used. If
                                  a file in the directory will be uploaded in
                                  multiple parts, this option disables those
                                  parts from being uploaded in parallel. This
                                  applies to all files being uploaded in
                                  multiple parts
  --parallel-upload-count INTEGER
                                  The number of parallel operations to perform.
                                  Decreasing this value will make bulk uploads
                                  less resource intensive but they may take

$ oci os object put --help
Usage: oci os object put [OPTIONS]

  Creates a new object or overwrites an existing one.

  The object can be uploaded as a single part or as multiple parts. Below are
  the rules for whether an object will be uploaded via single or multipart
  upload (listed in order of precedence):

      * If the object is being uploaded from STDIN, it will be uploaded as a
      multipart upload (if the object content is smaller than --part-size,
      default for STDIN is 10 MiB, the multipart upload may contain only one
      part, but it will still use the MultipartUpload API)

      * If the --no-multipart flag is specified, the object will be uploaded
      as a single part regardless of size (specifying --no-multipart when
      uploading from STDIN will result in an error)

      * If the object is larger than --part-size, it will be uploaded as
      multiple parts (the default part size is 128 MiB)

      * If the object is empty it will be uploaded as a single part

  Example:     oci os object put -ns mynamespace -bn mybucket --name
  myfile.txt --file /Users/me/myfile.txt --metadata
  '{"key1":"value1","key2":"value2"}'

Options:
  -ns, --namespace TEXT           The top-level namespace used for the request.

  --no-overwrite                  If the object already exists, do not overwrite
                                  the existing object.
  --no-multipart                  Do not use multipart uploads to upload the
                                  file in parts. By default files above 128 MiB
                                  will be uploaded in multiple parts, then
                                  combined server-side.

$ oci os preauth-request --help
Usage: oci os preauth-request [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Pre-authenticated requests provide a way to let users access a bucket or an
  object without having their own credentials. When you create a pre-
  authenticated request, a unique URL is generated. Users in your
  organization, partners, or third parties can use this URL to access the
  targets identified in the pre-authenticated request. See [Managing Access to
  Buckets and Objects].

  To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy.
  If you're not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you're an
  administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see [Getting
  Started with Policies].
