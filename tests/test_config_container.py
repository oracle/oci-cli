# Below custom hostname matcher for VCR cassettes is created to allow running VCRs recorded on different tenancies

# Hostname matching for VCR cassettes is based on below criteria:
# 1. If both the requests 'path' contain 'SDKTestingService' string, we declare the hostnames match i.e. we ignore the
# hostnames in http requests while doing the hostname matching and treat them as match
# 2. If the requests have the same 'service name' in the hostname string, we consider them as match i.e. we ignore the
# region name, subdomain and domain name part of the endpoint string and only consider the service name part for
# matching.
# Note: The endpoint naming convention has recently changed and we will need to be backward compatible. To support this
#       requirement, VCR Host matcher uses a utility API "get_servicename_from_endpoint" defined below which extracts
#       service name from the old or new style endpoint string passed as argument to it.
# In future, if there are more conditions for hostname or some of the above assumptions change, the matcher needs to
# change as well.
# Inputs:
# r1 - vcr.Request object corresponding to the http request that was made during the recording of the
# cassette.
# r2 - vcr.Request object corresponding to the http request created while running the test
# Note: 'host' and 'path' are properties in vcr.Request object. 'host' property contains the hostname of the http
#       request. For example: kms.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com. 'path' property contains the path of the http request.
