This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the file://path/to/file syntax.

The --generate-param-json-input option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the file:// syntax.

# need to be provided as JSON. These still come across as strings on the command line (e.g. as
# a literal JSON string or as a file:// path), so the type here is currently more a convenience
# to easily flag/denote these as different than a "normal" string
