**Important:**  Each tunnel in an IPSec connection can use either static routing or BGP dynamic routing (see the [IPSecConnectionTunnel] object's `routing` attribute). Originally only static routing was supported and every IPSec connection was required to have at least one static route configured. To maintain backward compatibility in the API when support for BPG dynamic routing was introduced, the API accepts an empty list of static routes if you configure both of the IPSec tunnels to use BGP dynamic routing. If you switch a tunnel's routing from `BGP` to `STATIC`, you must first ensure that the IPSec connection is configured with at least one valid CIDR block static route. Oracle uses the IPSec connection's static routes when routing a tunnel's traffic *only* if that tunnel's `routing` attribute = `STATIC`. Otherwise the static routes are ignored.

For the VCN, you specify a list of one or more IPv4 CIDR blocks that meet the following criteria:

- The CIDR blocks must be valid. - They must not overlap with each other or with the on-premises network CIDR block. - The number of CIDR blocks does not exceed the limit of CIDR blocks allowed per VCN.

For a CIDR block, Oracle recommends that you use one of the private IP address ranges specified in [RFC 1918] (10.0.0.0/8, 172.16/12, and 192.168/16). Example: 172.16.0.0/16. The CIDR blocks can range from /16 to /30.

For the purposes of access control, you must provide the [OCID] of the compartment where you want the VCN to reside. Consult an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure administrator in your organization if you're not sure which compartment to use. Notice that the VCN doesn't have to be in the same compartment as the subnets or other Networking Service components. For more information about compartments and access control, see [Overview of the IAM Service]. For information about OCIDs, see [Resource Identifiers].

You may optionally specify a *display name* for the VCN, otherwise a default is provided. It does not have to be unique, and you can change it. Avoid entering confidential information.

You can also add a DNS label for the VCN, which is required if you want the instances to use the Interent and VCN Resolver option for DNS in the VCN. For more information, see [DNS in Your Virtual Cloud Network].

The VCN automatically comes with a default route table, default security list, and default set of DHCP options. The [OCID] for each is returned in the response. You can't delete these default objects, but you can change their contents (that is, change the route rules, security list rules, and so on).

The VCN and subnets you create are not accessible until you attach an internet gateway or set up a Site-to-Site VPN or FastConnect. For more information, see [Overview of the Networking Service]. \n[Command Reference](createVcn)""")

* Assign a reserved public IP in your pool to a private IP. * Move a reserved public IP to a different private IP. * Unassign a reserved public IP from a private IP (which returns it to your pool of reserved public IPs). * Change the display name or tags for a public IP.

Assigning, moving, and unassigning a reserved public IP are asynchronous operations. Poll the public IP's `lifecycleState` to determine if the operation succeeded.

**Note:** When moving a reserved public IP, the target private IP must not already have a public IP with `lifecycleState` = ASSIGNING or ASSIGNED. If it does, an error is returned. Also, the initial unassignment from the original private IP always succeeds, but the assignment to the target private IP is asynchronous and could fail silently (for example, if the target private IP is deleted or has a different public IP assigned to it in the interim). If that occurs, the public IP remains unassigned and its `lifecycleState` switches to AVAILABLE (it is not reassigned to its original private IP). You must poll the public IP's `lifecycleState` to determine if the move succeeded.

Regarding ephemeral public IPs:

* If you want to assign an ephemeral public IP to a primary private IP, use [CreatePublicIp]. * You can't move an ephemeral public IP to a different private IP. * If you want to unassign an ephemeral public IP from its private IP, use [DeletePublicIp], which unassigns and deletes the ephemeral public IP.

**Note:** If a public IP is assigned to a secondary private IP (see [PrivateIp]), and you move that secondary private IP to another VNIC, the public IP moves with it.

**Note:** There's a limit to the number of [public IPs] a VNIC or instance can have.
